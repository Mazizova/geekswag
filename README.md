## Let‚Äôs help open-source projects in getting recognition
Open source is a big world. There are more than 100,000 open-source projects on GitHub alone. But how many of them do you personally know and use? Now you have a great opportunity to show a project that commands your respect to your surroundings - just put on a T-shirt with its design or take its mug to the office.
## Money contribution is a contribution too  
We know firsthand how difficult it is to develop free software used by thousands of developers, but not to be able to pay for hosting. Therefore, we donate 70% of the revenue from each purchase to OSS supporters.
Let your cool T-shirt be an every-day reminder of your contribution to the development of your favorite project.
## Only quality and genuine merchandise
We sell only branded merchandise. This means that we agree on collaborations with each project individually. We help them to finalize the corporate identity and create an individual design for each project. It doesn't matter whether it is printing or embroidery, we control the quality of our products to make you satisfied (and if not, we will refund your money). At the same time, we do not want the merch to cost a fortune. It is meant to be available to everyone.
# Are you an open-source software owner or maintainer?
We are open for cooperation with open-source projects of any scale and will be happy to create cool merchandise for your users.
